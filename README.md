# An Analysis of Kickstarter Data Using Excel

## Overview of Project
This project consisted of an analysis of Kickstarter data within an Excel Spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet contained an international collection of Kickstarter campaign data, with details such as:
* The fundraising goal, 
* Amount pledged, 
* Number of backers,
* Categorization of the campaign,
* The timing and duration of the campaign

Using this spreadsheet, an analysis was performed to discover the attributes of a successful Kickstarter campaign

### Purpose
This project was undertaken to provide insights to a Playwright who is interested in using data to build a successful Kickstarter campaign

## Analysis and Challenges
To prepare for the analysis, the contents of the spreadsheet were examined to identify the types of data and ensure they were all properly formatted. Additionally, conditional formatting was introduced to enable easier visual review of the spreadsheet contents regarding the outcome of the Kickstarter campaigns and the percent of funding received for each.

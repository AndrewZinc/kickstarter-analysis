Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
Kickstarter data is available in data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx (https://github.com/AndrewZinc/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx)

## Kickstarter Data
### Conditional formatting
Conditional formatting was added to more easily identify the outcome of the campaign and the amount of funding support.

### Analysis of the data
The following items were completed to characterize the campaign data and enable better decision-making:
* Separated Category and subcategory data
* Converted Unix timestamps for campaign creation and end dates
* Created Pivot tables for Category and subcategory data to more easily focus on specific data features
* Created a line chart to help identify the best time-of-year to launch a kickstarter campaign.
